# D Project Coding Rules

## UI Design Rules

1. **Grayscale UI**: Nothing besides the notes themselves should ever use colors. Everything except notes must be grayscale only.

   - Buttons, text, backgrounds, grids, etc. should all be grayscale (#fff, #ccc, #999, #333, #000, etc.)
   - Only the musical notes can have colors (they use the COLORS array for scale degree visualization)

2. **Minimal Icon Buttons**: For play/pause and similar controls:
   - Use just the icon with no background
   - No heavy outlines or text labels
   - Everyone understands standard icons (play, pause, stop, etc.)
   - Grayscale colors only (#ccc normal, #fff on hover)

## Development Workflow Rules

1. **No Dev Server Suggestions**: Never suggest running `npm dev` or similar dev commands after implementing features
   - The user runs the dev server continuously
   - They will check features themselves and report any errors
   - Only mention if there are actual linting errors detected
